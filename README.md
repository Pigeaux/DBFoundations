# Assignment 7

## Introduction
In this assignment, I will explain the utility of a SQL UDF and the differences between scalar, inline, and multi-statement functions.

## Topic
UDFs, or User Defined Functions, provide an easy to save complex or frequently used logic. If I would need to type the same select statement dozens of times each day, only changing certain variables within that statement, it would be useful to create a function out of that statement. Then it can be called up just by referencing the function.

Scalar functions return a single result. Inline functions return a table. Multi-statements also return a table but allow for more manipulation of the data and how it is organized in the table.

## Summary
Functions are a helpful way to streamline code and avoid duplicating work.
